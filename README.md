# Rust Tutorials

This is a project intended to help programmers learn the Rust programming language
by providing real-world tutorials.

The look and feel of the tutorials here is the same.  It is built using a static
page generator, Hugo, and the "learn" theme.

If you've authored a project that you would like to use a teach Rust concepts,
please consider submitting it as a PR here.  Editors are welcome!  These tutorials
will improve with your help.
